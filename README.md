# ES2015 - A Gentle Crashcourse (Presentation)

Now that we have ES6 -> ES5 transpiling happening automatically in all of our front end builds, I think it would be a good time to start utilizing some of the cool features the new language spec is providing us.

I’m not sure how much we’ll be able to cover in 1 hour, but let’s see how it goes and I can schedule subsequent meetings from there.

Here’s the agenda I’ve been working on:

- History of JS
- Future of JS
- Build procedure
- Reviewing variable and function hoisting
- Let, Const, and Block scoping,
- Rest parameters
- Spread operators
- Object destructuring
- Array destructuring
- Arrow functions
